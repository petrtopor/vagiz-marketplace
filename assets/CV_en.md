## Additional Information

**About me:**

I specialize in frontend development, including the creation of complex interactive interfaces, Telegram bots, web applications for them, and 2D games with physics (using pure JS with Phaser). I prefer `Vue.js`, but also have successful experience delivering large-scale projects with `Angular` (MVideo POS terminal admin panel) and `React` (Yandex GO Dev). I have a deep understanding of **pure JavaScript** principles and actively use it for developing core logic, custom solutions, and performance optimization.

I am highly proficient in related technologies:
1.  **CI/CD:** Capable of setting up Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
2.  **Testing:** Experienced with unit (Jest) and e2e (Cypress) testing; can assist manual QA teams in automating routine procedures.
3.  **Backend:** I have experience with `Node.js` and `.NET`, which allows me to easily understand server-side code, write controllers, or modify services if necessary.

I am a top-tier specialist, capable of working effectively in teams of any size and composition as a lead developer, team lead, or tech lead. I deliver predictable and productive work on any project. I build proficient and friendly interactions with business representatives and adjacent teams, guided by principles of prudence, technical expertise, and practical expediency.
